Build Systems:
1.)Compile the code->Run test(Unit & Integration Test)->Package (Jar & War)->Deploy & Run
All these tasks can be automated by gradle(Build Automation Tool)
2.)Gradle uses convention over configuration
3.)Gradle makes building & running applications very easy  

Gradle:
It uses Groovy/Kotlin languages inside the build.gradle files
build.gradle
->written in Groovy / Kotlin language
->equivalent of Maven's pom.xml

build.gradle(main build configuration file).It consists of plugins, metadata,dependencies,repositories
1)Plugin:
->war , jar , jacoco, bootrun(springboot)
->additional build functionality 

2)Metadata:
->build metadata gives information about your build

3)Repositories:
->place where to find dependencies

4)Dependencies:
->dependencies or artifacts that are required to run a project
