Computer Networks:

Loadbalancing:
-> distribute network traffic over multiple servers
-> to ensure no single server is overwhemled by traffic

CDN(Content Delivery Network):
-> network of servers that are geographically distributed - that work together to deliver web content to     users
-> CDN servers can help to handle heavy traffic loads
-> popular CDN providers include Akamai, Cloudflare, and Amazon CloudFront.

DNS(Domain Name System):
->It translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that machines can understand.
->When you enter a domain name into your web browser - computer sends a request to a DNS         resolver - searches for the IP address associated with that domain name - sends that information     back to your computer - this helps us to connect to the correct server

SSL(Secure Socket Layer):
->security protocol - used to establish an encrypted connection between a web server and a web    browser.
->to protect sensitive information - such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data       - from being intercepted by third parties while in transit over the internet.

Layers of OSI Model:
1) Physical Layer:
     -> physical aspects of network communication, such as electrical, mechanical, and timing interfaces.
     -> physical characteristics of the transmission medium, such as cable types, connector types, and transmission rates.
2) Data Link Layer: 
     -> framing data into packets, detecting errors, and retransmitting lost or damaged packets.
     -> Examples of data link layer protocols include Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
3) Network Layer:
     ->  Routing data packets between devices on different networks.
     ->  The Internet Protocol (IP) is an example of a network layer protocol.
4) Transport Layer:
     ->  provides end-to-end communication between devices on a network.
     ->  reliable delivery of data by providing error detection, flow control, and congestion control           mechanisms.
     ->  TCP(transfer) & UDP(user datagram) are examples of transport layer protocols.
5) Session Layer:
     -> provides services such as session synchronization and recovery in case of interruptions.
6) Presentation Layer:
     -> provides a standardized format for data exchange between applications
     -> performs data compression, encryption, and decryption to ensure that data can be transmitted          and  received in a usable format.
7) Application Layer:
     ->  provides services directly to end-users. 
     ->  application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and Telnet,
